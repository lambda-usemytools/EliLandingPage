            <h2>How It Works</h2>

            <div class="how-it-works-div">

                <div>
                    <p>When you create an account with Use My Tools you can easily add all of the tools that you have 
                        in your garage.  When you add those tools you can choose if you want the tool to be available 
                        to your garage only, your network , or out for rental.  When an item is available to your garage 
                        only, it will not show up as available in any searches when someone is looking to borrow or rent 
                        a tool. A tool that is added for your network can be loaned out to anyone you have chosent to add 
                        to your network.  You might not get paid for loaning out tools to your network, 
                        but hopefully they will return the favor.  </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>A tool that is added for rental will show up when local Use My Tools users search for that tool.  
                        If that user likes the price you have set and wants to rent that tool from you, 
                        they will be able to request it.  Once they request it, you will see their profile 
                        and their previous reviews.  If you agree to rent the tool to that person, 
                        Use My Tools will process the payment and hold a deposit in escrow.  
                        You and the borrower will agree on a pickup and drop off location 
                        and the borrower will get your tool for the amount of time agreed upon.  </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>Once the rental period is over the borrower will return the tool 
                        and you will receive your payment.  If any damage should happen to your tool 
                        or anything should go wrong, a Use My Tools representative is always there to help resolve 
                        the issue.  </p>
