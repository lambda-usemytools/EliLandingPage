# EliLandingPage
Landing Page for Use My Tools.

Also added About Page, and FAQ. 

Uses less css. Make sure to run less-watch-compile less css index.less 
before making changes to less files.

Uses Javascript for tabs and accordions.
The tab section on the about page is pretty full in mobile view, so if you're adding tabs, change the css.

The reason for two accordion js files is that I wrote and styled the html first, and the accordion.js doesn't work with the faq accordion setup (which is a better setup, imo, but not sure it works well with the other pages).

Header and footer should be compatible with more pages, just make sure to change h1, nav a's, and import the script for mobile nav.
